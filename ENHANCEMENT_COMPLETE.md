- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript implementation with proper schemas

### 🎯 Key Improvements Addressed

| **Previous Limitation** | **v2.0 Solution** |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Complex table extraction without external tools | ✅ Enhanced text-based detection + pdfplumber integration |
| Scanned PDFs require OCR for text extraction | ✅ Automatic OCR fallback with tesseract |
| Password-protected PDFs not supported | ✅ Password parameter on all tools |
| Very large PDFs may have memory constraints | ✅ Memory optimization and chunking |
| Image analysis beyond OCR is limited | ✅ Comprehensive image extraction tools |

### 🏃 Ready to Use

The enhanced PDF MCP Server v2.0 is now:
- ✅ **Built successfully** with TypeScript compilation
- ✅ **Dependencies installed** and verified working
- ✅ **Tested operational** with all new features
- ✅ **Backward compatible** with existing workflows

You can now process password-protected PDFs, extract text from scanned documents, get enhanced table data, and handle large files efficiently!
