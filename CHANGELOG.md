## Version History

### Release Planning

- **v1.0.0** - Initial public release with core functionality
- **v1.1.0** - Performance optimizations and additional PDF formats
- **v1.2.0** - Enhanced table detection and extraction
- **v2.0.0** - Major architecture improvements and new features

### Breaking Changes

None yet - this is the initial release.

### Migration Guide

This is the first public release, so no migration is needed.

### Security

- All PDF processing is done locally - no data is sent to external services
- File system access is limited to the configured working directory
- Input validation using Zod schemas prevents malicious inputs

### Performance Notes

- PDF processing is done synchronously to ensure data consistency
- Memory usage scales with PDF size - monitor for very large documents
- Enhanced features (OCR, image extraction) have additional processing overhead

### Known Issues

- Very large PDFs (>100MB) may cause memory issues
- Complex table layouts may not extract perfectly
- OCR accuracy depends on image quality in PDFs
- Some encrypted PDFs may not be readable

### Upcoming Features

- Batch PDF processing
- PDF comparison tools
- Advanced text search and highlighting
- Support for more document formats (Word, PowerPoint)
- Streaming processing for large documents
